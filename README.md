# CAUCI-Coin-Wars-with-SQLite
Python Program For CAUCI's Coin Wars Fundraiser with using SQLite to store data

Chinese Association at Univeristy of California, Irvine has an annual fundraiser every year during winter quarter.
The goal of the fundraiser is for board officers to collect unneeded change from general members as much as possible. It is
a contest of who can collect the most coins; however, general members can also donate whole dollars to bring down the score of
board officers. At the end of the 10 weeks, the top three players win and get a prize!

                  Rules:
----------------------------------------------
1. Total Points/Score = Coins - Dollars
2. Dollars donated MUST BE Whole Dollar Bills (usually donated to top players to bring them down from first 3 places)

Currently the point of this small project is to host a website that has a table revealing the players and their stats. The website
would be updated weekly and would be hopefully be a way for general members at CAUCI to help keep track of the fundraising game!
